The Expo team has been building open source libraries for React Native since the beginning of React Native. Expo's libraries are used by thousands of apps, but it's historically been difficult to measure just how impactful Expo's libraries are.

Unlike the web where you can easily detect what frameworks or libraries a website is using, it's much more difficult to detect what libraries are used in native iOS apps.

In my personal time, I built a rube goldberg-styled system to measure and detect which apps are using Expo's open source libraries, specifically the [**Expo SDK**](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/), and the navigation suite [**React Navigation**](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation).

The results were astounding. I quickly discovered the rate limit for downloading apps and how easy it is to get your account closed. After months of collection, I'm proud to present a list of **<TotalApps /> apps** that are using **Expo in 2023**.
