Expo is a framework for building universal React apps. I've always wondered who uses our open source libraries and how impactful they are. Unlike the web where you can easily detect what frameworks or libraries a website is using, it's much more difficult to detect what apps are using your libraries.

In my personal time, I built a system to measure and detect which apps are using Expo, specifically which iOS apps were using either the Expo SDK, or the Expo navigation library React Navigation.
