<Title date="2024-01-04T00:00:00.000Z">Who's using Expo OSS in 2024</Title>

The Expo team has been building open source libraries for React Native since the beginning. GitHub indicates there are +783k public repos using Expo, but it's historically been difficult to measure just how impactful Expo's libraries are to end-users.

After months of research, I'm proud to present a list of **<TotalApps /> apps** that are using **Expo in 2024**. Specifically libraries from the [**Expo SDK**](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/), including Expo's navigation suite [**React Navigation**](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation).
