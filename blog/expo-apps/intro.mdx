The Expo team has been building open source libraries for React Native since its inception in 2015. GitHub indicates there are +783k public repos using Expo OSS, but it has historically been difficult to measure just how impactful Expo's libraries are to end-users.

After months of extensive research, I've collected a list of **<TotalApps /> apps** that are using **Expo in 2026** (tracking since 2024). Specifically apps using libraries from the [**Expo SDK**](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/), including Expo's navigation suite [**React Navigation**](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation).
