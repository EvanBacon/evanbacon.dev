## About this website

This project is built with Expo as a way to dogfood the tools I build.

- [**Expo Router**](https://docs.expo.dev/routing/introduction/) is the framework responsible for routing and providing opinions for streamlining development.
- [`@bacons/mdx`](https://github.com/evanbacon/expo-mdx) is a markdown parser for Metro bundler. I use this for writing Markdown that is compiled to React components. This powers the blog and other text-driven aspects of the project, like this bulleted list.
- [`@expo/html-elements`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@expo/html-elements) this is a strictly-typed DOM-based component library for React Native.
