I'm Evan Bacon, an artist and technologist. I'm currently leading and building developer tooling at [Expo](https://expo.dev), the universal React framework. I started working on Expo in 2017
with the goal to make mobile content easy to create, share, and
discover.

Previously, I worked as the sole design technologist on the
SiriusXM (360L) in-car and mobile experiences. Before software
development, I was an award-winning Lego artist, specializing in
life-sized sculptures.
