I'm Evan Bacon, an artist and technologist. I'm currently leading and building developer tooling for [**Expo**](https://expo.dev), the universal React framework. I started working on Expo in 2017
with the goal to make mobile experiences easy to create, share, and
discover.

Previously, I worked as the Design Technologist on the
[**SiriusXM**](https://www.motortrend.com/features/what-is-siriusxm-with-360l-streaming-audio/) 360L in-car and mobile experiences. Before software
development, I was an award-winning [**Lego**](https://www.austinchronicle.com/best-of-austin/year:2013/poll:critics/category:kids/bacon-bricks-best-big-lego-builder/) artist, specializing in
life-sized sculptures.

I built my first Lego sculpture––a life-sized Batman statue––when I was 13 years old. The Batman was debuted at the first Lego conference in my hometown of Austin, TX––Brick Fiesta. I continued building sculptures and teaching myself how to build apps throughout my teenage years. Learn more: [**Frequently Asked Questions**](/faq).
