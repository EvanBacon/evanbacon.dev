I'm Evan Bacon, an artist and technologist. I'm currently leading and building developer tooling at [**Expo**](https://expo.dev), the universal React framework. I started working on Expo in 2017
with the goal to make mobile content easy to create, share, and
discover.

Previously, I worked as the sole design technologist on the
[**SiriusXM 360L**](https://www.motortrend.com/features/what-is-siriusxm-with-360l-streaming-audio/) in-car and mobile experiences. Before software
development, I was an award-winning Lego artist, specializing in
life-sized sculptures.

I built my first Lego sculpture––a life-sized Batman statue––when I was 13 years old. The Batman was debuted at the first Lego conference in my hometown of Austin, TX––Brick Fiesta. I continued building sculptures and teaching myself how to build apps throughout my teenage years.
